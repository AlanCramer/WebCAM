        <h2>What is CNC?</h2>        
        <p class="content"> 
        Maybe in some sense it is the opposite of 3D Printing. Instead of adding material 
        layer by layer, it cuts out material from a sheet. Maybe carving something intricate
        or carving parts that can be assembled into something else.

        <h2>How does this page work?</h2>        
        <p class="content"> 
        User draws a picture of what they want, enters information about the CNC machine they 
        will use, and downloads an instruction file to feed to the machine.
        </p>

        <h2>Why?</h2>
        <p class="content"> 
        2D is easier than 3D.

        <h2>About Resolutions</h2>
        <p class="content"> 
        There are several related concepts about resolutions.         
        <ul class="texty-list">
            <li> <b>Import Image Resolution</b> <br> Imported images have a width and height. PNG and SVG might map these 
                to physical units.
            </li>
            <li> <b>Canvas Model Resolution</b> <br> When the canvas is created, there is a width and height. 
                This describes the canvas model. 
            </li>
            <li> <b>Canvas Display Resolution</b> <br> The canvas can be styled and given a new width and height.
                This changes how the canvas gets displayed but not the underlying model. 
            </li>
            <li> <b>Toolpath Calculation Resoution</b> <br>To calculate the toolpaths, the canvas will be copied to another
                image which is not displayed. This image can have yet another resolution. 
            </li>
