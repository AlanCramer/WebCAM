        <h2>What is CNC?</h2>        
        <p class="content"> 
        Maybe in some sense it is the opposite of 3D Printing. Instead of adding material 
        layer by layer, it cuts out material from a sheet. Maybe carving something intricate
        or carving parts that can be assembled into something else.

        <h2>How does this page work?</h2>        
        <p class="content"> 
        User draws a picture of what they want, enters information about the CNC machine they 
        will use, and downloads an instruction file to feed to the machine.
        </p>

        <h2>Why?</h2>
        <p class="content"> 
        2D is easier than 3D.

        <h2>About Resolutions</h2>
        <p class="content"> 
        There are several related concepts about resolutions.         
        <ul class="texty-list">
            <li> <b>Imported Image Model Resolution</b> <br> Imported images have a width and height as part of the file.
                PNG and SVG might map these to physical units. When the image is read in, these units are 
                reflected in the image.naturalWidth and image.naturalHeight.
            </li>
            <li> <b>Imported Image Display Resolution</b> <br> When the image is rendered, it can be assigned a 
                width and height in canvas model units. This is held in the image.width and image.height.
            </li>
            <li> <b>Canvas Model Resolution</b> <br> When the canvas is created, there is a width and height. 
                This describes the canvas model. 
            </li>
            <li> <b>Canvas Display Resolution</b> <br> The canvas can be styled and given a new width and height.
                This changes how the canvas gets displayed but not the underlying model. This seems like it 
                would be a useful parameter for zooming in on the scene. But unfortunately browsers don't do
                this very well. My guess is they double the pixels and then blur. So the result is bigger but fuzzy.
                Ideally, a vector image like SVG would scale and maintain crisp edges 
                and a bitmap image like PNG would pixelate. Yes, we want it to pixelate because that's what input
                image told us to do. <br> So we don't want to change this parameter.
            </li>
            <li> <b>Toolpath Calculation Resoution</b> <br>To calculate the toolpaths, the canvas will be copied to another
                image which is not displayed. This image can have yet another resolution. 
            </li>
        </ul>
